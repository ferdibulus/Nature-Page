            <p>On ACT Reading<br/>
                <br/> You'll encounter questions that ask you to be able to read large amounts of text and distill them down; we call these "big picture" questions here at PrepScholar. Big picture questions can ask about the entire passage, a series of paragraph, or even just one paragraph (as opposed to "little picture" questions, which will ask for specific information). Being able to answer these types of questions will prove very useful for college/university, where professors will expect you to use these skills with even more dense and academic writing.

                    What are “big picture” questions on ACT Reading, and what are the best ways to approach answering them? I’ll start by discussing the two primary types of big picture questions you’ll encounter on the ACT, along with common ways the ACT will ask you about each. After that, I’ll give you some strategies to answer both types of questions, illustrated with examples from prose fiction and academic writing.

                    Type 1: Main Point Questions<br/>
                    
                     
                    First of all, what is the main point of a passage or paragraph? For Social Science, Humanities, and Natural Science passages, the main point is the central argument. It's a little more complicated for Prose Fiction or Literary narrative, since they don’t always have central arguments; for these passage types, the main point is often the central conflict and its implications. If you're stumped, it can also sometimes help to think of the main point of a Prose Fiction/Literary Narrative passage as a short summary of what happens, or even the “moral of the story.”
                    
                    Questions that ask you about the main point are not asking about the topic, or theme, of the writing, but are instead looking for something more specific. The main point should answer the question, “so what’s the author’s point in this paragraph/passage?” in a short sentence. <br/>
                
                    <h1>Identifying Main Point Questions</h1><br/>
                    It’s usually pretty clear when you’re being asked about the main point of a passage. The wording will go something like the following (all extracted from and modified from actual SAT questions):
                    
                    “Which of the following statements best expresses the main idea of the passage?”
                    “The primary focus of lines 65-92 is..."
                    "The author’s main purpose in lines 54-69 is to show..."
                    “The main theme of this passage concerns the...”
                    “The main idea of the first paragraph is that the music of the video game Portal...”
                    </p>
